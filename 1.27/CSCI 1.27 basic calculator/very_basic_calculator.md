# Exercise 1.27 - Very basic calculator
very basic calculator

# Description
The goal of this exercise is to write a very basic calculator. Given some lines
of mathematical expression strings, you are asked to print out the results.

# Input
The input consists of the number of strings, n, in the first line and followed by n
expression strings in separate lines. The characters allowed in the expression strings
are ’+’, ’-’, ’0’, ’1’, ’2’, ’3’, ’4’, ’5’, ’6’, ’7’, ’8’, ’9’, and space character. You can
assume that all the expressions in the input are valid. Moreover, each input integer is
non-negative and the range of the input integers is [0, 2000000000].

# Output
The output should have n lines. Each line is the result of the corresponding expression. The output may contain negative integers and the range of the output is
[−2000000000, 2000000000].

# Sample Input
- 3
- 4+3
- 5 + 2 - 10
- 9999 + 20001 - 1001

# Sample Output
- 7
- -3
- 28999
